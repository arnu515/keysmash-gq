# KeySmash - Free courses for everyone

[KeySmash](https://keysmash.gq] is a website which provies free courses contributed by generous people to the world wide web. KeySmash was coded in [Svelte Kit](https://kit.svelte.dev) and uses [Supabase](https://supabase.io) for the backend

KeySmash is live at <https://keysmash.gq> and is hosted with [Vercel](https://vercel.com)!

KeySmash uses Supabase to handle:
- Auth
- All data
- User-uploaded course covers via supabase storage

KeySmash was inspired by 🥚 [EggHead.io](https://egghead.io)
